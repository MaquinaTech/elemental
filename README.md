# Project: Elemental

This project is a solution for a technical test offered by the Laurel Gaming company to Nicolás López de Lerma López. 
The goal of the test is to deploy a mobile app using React Native with Expo.

    Node.js (Recomended Version: LTS)
    npm (Comes bundled with Node.js)
    Expo CLI (To run the application in a mobile development environment)

You can verify that everything is installed correctly by running the following commands in the terminal:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   expo --version
   ```
